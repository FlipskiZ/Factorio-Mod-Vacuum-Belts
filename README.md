# Factorio-Mod-Vacuum-Belts

A new late-game vacuum belt tier that transports items very quickly, 120 items per second. 3x as fast as an express belt. If you wish, you can change the speed in the mod settings menu. And also remove the belt restrictions and reduce recipe difficulty.

The drawback of these belts is that you can't directly connect them to other belts, or have inserters interact with the items on top. They have to go through a splitter first. Not to mention their high crafting complexity.

I had originally planned to make the belts look like vacuum tubes, but that appears to be very hard if not impossible due to how the render layering system works in the game. Since belt-type entities are hardcoded to be rendered under items. For an in-universe explanation for why the belts are called vacuum belts beyond me just being lazy, is that they use special vacuum suction in order to keep items in place. Allowing super-fast speeds at the cost of flexibility.
